# Welcome to Student Feedback System!

**Overview**
This platform is built for students so that they can send feedback to their teachers on their lectures. There are two basic modules on the project:

 1. Student Module
 2. Teacher's Module

**Student's Module**:
Students can login to the platform using their organisation email address and password. Since this is an organisation level project so no signup is required. 
Once login is validated, students can see their own previous feedback and choose to send new feedback. There will be option to give ratings out of 10 and send a customer feedback message. Also, there will be option to choose a subject which they wish to leave feedback. Once feedback is left, it will be stored in database. 

**Teacher's Module**:
Teacher can login to the platform using their organisation email address and password. They will be able to see anonymous custom feedback and average of all the ratings out of 10.
